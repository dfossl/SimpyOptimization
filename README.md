# SimpyOptimization
Working on some machine learning for optimizing in static and dynamic simulations

## What has been done:
- implimented a dynamic k-beam search of states
- As a proof of concept used simple teather simlation and optimized worker types on budget and wait time using k-beam
- Implimented the start of an emergency room simulation for optimization work.

## TODOs
- improve emergency room simulation to be more dynamic with paient types and resource allocation.
- impliment genetic algorithm for optimizations.
- Make emeregency room simulation more dynamic and look to impliment reinforcement learning for scheduling agent (Deep-Q likely).
- Make standardized yaml format files for input into simulation.
